# FE + Web3 Test 2024

**Description:**
1. Create a Next.js application using typescript, Next.js's app router, tailwind, and any additional libraries, and frameworks of your choice. 
2. The App should have state to store: "Selected Asset". Potential selectable assets are Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Arbitrum (ARB).
3. Reproduce the following Dropdown selector UI in React, using coingecko's free API to fetch the current market price and 24hr price change of the selected asset.

Notes:
- Please create this repo inside your own github profile, and give me access to it. 
- Prices in white are asset price, and below are 24 hr price change. If negative it should be red. If positive, in green. 
- The Figma design has a small mistake: a minus (-) sign for a positive/green 24hr price change:
